"Software are Made by Humans, Mainly" is a category given to posts about how us, humans, can make good software. Software writing relies heavily on the human brain's creativity. Mathematics, Physics or Biology don't really help us there, not directly anyway. Making software is a very soft science, which makes a lot of people call it art. I don't care how we call it, but I guess you see my point, we are left alone with our cognitive capacity, experiences, and social skills. No hard science.

Starting from the fact that we poor human beings, with our qualities and weaknesses, are the main factor in the future relevance of the software, it makes me see software making from a different angle. It makes me think that maybe there are many practices that we should abandon, or take on, to get better at what we do. Finding a sweet spot of efficiency for the different practices involved in making software, that's what this category is about.

Being able to concentrate is what allows us to do any work. An important thing to take into account is that there are different kinds of concentration for different activities. We can divide these activities in 3 different buckets: social, physical and cerebral. The one I'll focus on in this post is the cerebral one. In this category I would put programming, writing, reading, learning and any other similarly quiet but intense activities. This post will walk you through the reasons why concentration can be difficult when the task at hand is hard. External interruptions is far from being the only issue there. Then we'll see that some surprisingly easy solutions to improve your performance exist.

# Why can it be hard to concentrate?

As for all psychological issues, there are many way to put words on them. For this case, I feel like we don't need any complex model. Consciousness and subconscious concept will be enough. 

We will define concentration as the act of your conscious thinking staying focused on your task. If your conscious thinking changes subject, you lose. On the other side of consciousness, we have the subconscious. A very complex, powerful and susceptible beast. It is the animal in us. Hundreds of millions of years of animal evolution forged its organization. Only hundreds of thousands of years forged consciousness. Actually much less if you consider written work. And just a few decades if you consider programming.

Now don't think that the subconscious is useless for programming. We teach our subconscious to understand and remember abstract models. We can teach it to combine these abstractions and create new abstractions. Without our subconscious, we wouldn't even be able to learn. When I speak about subconscious and concentration, I use a very targeted family of verbs: "serve", "teach", "learn", "understand", "remember". This is the same vocabulary you'd use if you were speaking about teaching a student. And like most students the subconscious is wild if untamed.

The untamed subconscious will try to interrupt you all the time. Slightly hungry? There is still that piece of cake left over from yesterday, better eat it now before forgetting it. A bit tired? A coffee will definitely help. By the way, yesterday's date was a disaster, let's redo a better version of it in our head. No really can't concentrate. Maybe I should change job. 

Even though concentration is the direct work of consciousness, it is the state of the subconscious that dictates if there is concentration or no concentration.

# Right, got it. So how would you go about to tame your subconscious?

Taming is not putting in jail your subconscious. Your subconscious needs to have some freedom to go about and find the pieces of knowledge that will fit the problem at hand. A powerful concentration is a concentration where the subconscious is the most free while still controlled by your conscious thoughts. Some people call this the zone. Of course you don't have to be in the zone to do every piece of work, but you do need a certain degree of concentration.

To reach a decent level of concentration easily, a solution which works consistently is to keep the subconscious slightly busy. You can typically do that with sounds. Sounds that won't trigger any reaction, just background sounds. It can be nature sounds, ambient music, white noise. You don't want too much energy in these sounds otherwise they just focus your attention on them. And on you don't want these sounds to put you to sleep either.

What you want is sounds tailored for concentration. And this stuff exists. I came across one particular startup, [focus@will](https://www.focusatwill.com), that focuses on exactly that, helping you to tame your subconscious. The field of mind manipulation has been historically a bit esoteric, but there is some quantitative science beginning to emerge in the specific field of concentration. And this startup is building on that science. It is not hard science of course, so there is a lot of trying and testing, but they reached some great results already. A lot of people thank them. And I am among these people.

What they do is streaming music. In the past I've played a lot with working with music, all kinds of music. Or no music at all, tyring to have an environment as quiet as possible. Results vary a lot, and still depend on my mood and degrees of sleepiness. So what do they do differently? They follow the concentration cycles. To begin concentration the mind needs to be tamed and calmed. But to keep the concentration up and avoiding dreaming, the subconscious needs a slightly more important stimulation every 20 min. Overall, continuous periods of 90 minutes of efficient work is the average total concentration time that people tend to achieve before a break.

90 minutes of productive concentration is actually pretty close to my experience with the service. This is the kind of concentration I would reach if I have a deadline the next day. In my experience, this is big, really big.

# Is the concentration reached with focus@will the "zone"?

I'm not quite sure what the zone is. It seems to be one of these words where everybody has a definition of it, but they are never quite the same. A bit like "love". Some people say they fall in love all the time, others say once in a lifetime. Some will say there is no love without passion, others that passion is not the same as love. Go figure out.

# I realize that some days, I'm flying through difficult problems. But the next day can find myself completely stupid in front a very similar challenge. Can something like focus@will help me there?

I think so. I realized that even if I'm tired, I quickly forget I'm tired and focus on the task. It's the same if something bothers me, it really helps to get your mind off it.

# What happens if I'm in the middle of work session and get interrupted?

In theory, you are not supposed to be interrupted. That's why there is no pause on the player. Basically if you stop the music, that means you stop the session. In practice, I just cut the music volume, deal with the interruption and go back to work. Now does the music streaming help going back to work? I think so, because it makes you more conscious about the fact you are in a work session and you will deal with the interruption as quickly as possible. I also get the feeling it helps restoring your context as your brain will associate the music with the train of thought.

"Software are Made by People" is a category given to posts about how us, with all our shortcomings, can make good software. Software writing relies heavily on the human brain's creativity. Mathematics, Physics or Biology don't really help us there. Making software is a very soft science, which makes a lot of people call it art. I don't care how we call it, but we are definitely left alone with our cognitive capacity, experiences, and social skills. This is not a hard science.

Starting from the fact that we are the main factor in the future relevance of the software, it can make us see software making from a different angle. This new angle can make us realise that there are many practices out there that we should avoid, or take on, to get better at what we do. Finding that sweet spot of efficiency for the different practices involved in making software, that's what this category is about.

Software and money.

Software must be also a revenue generator for users, not only a cost generator.
At the moment, the closer the software is to the user, the more cost it generates. The user can also generate value for a software product. A user idea for the product can definitely be relevant to other users and then sold to them, thus generating revenues for both the users having ideas and the people transforming the vision into a product. The impact of that is that software will tend to be more finished and useful. Working with bad software is frustrating, it is counter-productive, and makes you want to avoid using that software altogether. On the contrary working with good software is inspiring, it will open new ways to do the job, which will trigger new ideas again, creating a virtuous circle. It is like reaching a new level everytime, instead of just struggling to keep the same level you had before.

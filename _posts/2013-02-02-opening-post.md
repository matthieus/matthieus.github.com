This is a meta post introducing the blog.

As the title says, this blog will mainly be about making software. In making software I'm including all sort of activities, be it writing code, project management, open source, product design, tools and process ... anything really. As the "mainly" from the blog title implies, I might also write about other subjects.

The main purpose of this blog, as for a lot of blogs out there, is to be a place to formulate thoughts I think are important to me. Publishing writings puts a particular pressure on the writer where he will try pretty hard not to be ashamed of what he is putting out there. This pressure will, hopefully, make me organise these thoughts in a readable manner.

Another related purpose is exchange. I hope, with this blog, to exchange ideas and enrich them with smart comments from you, dear reader. Which brings us back to the readability of my work. So first thing first, readable posts about making software, mainly.

**Note about the blogging platform:** This blog uses [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) to create the HTML, [Jekyll-bootstrap](http://jekyllbootstrap.com/) to bootstrap the blog's code and [Mark Reid](http://mark.reid.name/)'s [theme](https://github.com/jekyllbootstrap/theme-mark-reid) for the display. All of this code being open source. Thanks a million, authors of these projects, for giving away your work to the Community. Plus [Github](https://github.com/) provides this amazingly handy service by hosting the blog and its code freely, thank you for that Github.

Making software is difficult, but not for everybody. Some people, often small teams or even lone developers, will create true gems which can be a magnitude better than what a company on a large budget will release. I could give examples like the first Unix or most computer languages, but you all have seen some brilliant piece of software written by one guy, or a small team that worked particularly well together.

As a side note, you might wonder how to judge software, how to know it is brilliant. I'm very much interested in the subject but I'll keep that one for another time as this post is about to take a very different direction. Let's assume brilliant software is software which will make most users consistently happy. Hard to not agree with that one.

When making software, if you want to make a user happy you have to *be* that user. When I use "you", it's either "you" the lone developer, or "you" the team involved in the making. From that logic, you realise quickly the ideal world is a developer developing software for himself. And most of the time that's when good software is made.

Now let's take look at a standard random software company which makes software for other companies. Let's assume the software company is building a new product from scratch because a prospect said he could possibly be interested. If the software company doesn't employ any user, or ex-user, with some sort of vision of what the product is going to be, our software company will have to rely on its relations with the client to know what should go in that product. We'll assume it is the case. <br>
A standard project organisation would be:
0. Client agrees to buy the future product and design it in the same time
1. Client creates a project team on his side, users are part of it in the limit of their availibility
2. Software company creates a project team, with a product owner, a project lead and developers.
3. Workshops are organised to flesh out the requirements. These involve product owner, project lead from client and a couple of potential users
4. Development is done with some intermediary validations from the client in an Agile way
5. Final release is done after 1 year of development

Let's assume everything went well: the client was relatively mature about what he wanted, the specifications were as good as a specification can be, the development team worked well together.

This way to do things is a very standard, proven by the market way to make software. Billions are made by software companies who sell software made this way, SAP being the first best example of that model.

But this kind of software doesn't make users consistently happy, they will still have bouts of nostalgia for the Excel sheet being replaced, this is not brilliant software. My opinion is that this result is unavoidable with this model of making software, simply because this model is too far from the model that made brilliant software possible. The makers are far too far from the users. The software makers cannot *be* the users in such an organisation.

How can we make the development team *be* the users? Asking the question is half the answer: we need to make them work together. By working together I really mean it, users being part of the team. Users testing the software with their own data that they know and understand. Users having ideas directly discussed with the product owner and the developers. The users understanding the logic behind a software product making, which will structure their own ideas and vision. If they can, a few chosen users should leave their normal day job and become software designer for the time of the project. That kind of working together.

How could such a process work when it involves two companies with completely different goals? "Software as a partner" is the title of this blog post, and I think it sums it up. Both companies have to work as partners, not client and provider. This kind of partnership can be done. Partnership generally implies sharing revenue, and that's where the conflict of goals disappears. If you build something together, it makes sense to share whatever good comes out of it.

Just creating a partnership won't create brilliant software magically of course. But it's going in the right direction.

Making good software is difficult, but not for everybody. Some people, often small teams or lone developers, will create true gems which can be tenfold better than what a company on a large budget will release. I could give examples like the first Unix and most computer languages, but you all have seen some brilliant piece of software written by one guy, or a small team that worked particularly well together.

As a side note, you might wonder how to judge software, how to know it is brilliant. I'm very much interested in the subject but I'll keep that one for another time as this post is about to take a different direction. Let's assume brilliant software is software which will make most users consistently happy. Hard to not agree with that one.

When making software, if you want to make a user happy you have to think like him, you have to *be* the user. When I use "you", it's either "you" the lone developer, or "you" the team involved in the making. From that logic, you realise quickly the ideal world is a developer developing software for himself. And most of the time that's when good software is made.

Now let's take look at a standard scenario where a random software company makes software for other companies. Let's assume the software company is building a new product from scratch to help a client replace rudimentary tools by more efficient ones. If the software company doesn't employ any user, or ex-user, with some sort of vision of what the product is going to be, our software company will have to rely on its relations with the client to know what should go in that product. We'll assume it is the case. <br>
A standard project plan would be:
0. Client agrees to buy the future product
1. Client creates a project team on its side, users are part of it in the limit of their availibility
2. Software company creates a project team, with a product owner, a project lead and developers.
3. Workshops are organised to flesh out the requirements
4. Development is done with some intermediary validations from the client in an Agile way
5. Final delivery going live is done after 1 year of development


Let's assume everything went well: the client was relatively mature about what he wanted, the specifications were as good as a specification can be, the development team worked well together.

This way to do things is a standard, proven by the market, way to make software. Billions are made by software companies which sell software made this way, SAP being the first and best example for that model.

But this kind of software doesn't make users consistently happy. They will still have bouts of nostalgia for the Excel sheet being replaced. What will be missing is an efficient workflow and some consistency throughout all the features. Usability will also be an issue. The whole application will feel like there could have been more maturation. It's important to note that this is usually fine as the benefit of having a standard application throughout the company is a great step forward for reliability and reporting capabilities.

This is not brilliant software though. The brilliant software should make the user forget about Excel and what he was using it for. But this result is not attainable with this standard model of making software. The makers are far too far from the users and their detailed needs and all the things that go in their heads when they work. Even if the teams are small, there are too many stakeholders, too many decision makers. The necessary iterative loops to improve features are simply too slow to reach mature features in a reasonable timeframe.

To reach maturity quickly, there is only one way, the makers need to *be* the user. How can this happen? Asking the question is half the answer: the users need to be part of the development team. Users testing the software with their own data that they know and understand, users having ideas directly discussed with the product owner and developers, users understanding the logic behind a software product making, that kind of teamwork can make features maturity gain years compared with a process involving more intermediaries.

How could such a process work when it involves two companies with completely different goals? I don't know anything about partnership or consortium, but I feel that's what b2b software products need.

Creating good software for other people can be done, and for that the end user must be at the heart of the process.

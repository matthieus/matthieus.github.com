This post is about our most important tool to get shit done, concentration.

Concentration, or focus, is what allows us doing work. Any work. There are different degrees of concentration though. There are also contexts where concentration is more fragile than others. And finally there are triggers that make concentration easier. That's what I want to talk about in this post. With a particular focus on a tool that could make you more productive than you thought you could be.

To understand these triggers that make your concentration work, let's agree on some common ground about what concentration is. For that I'll use the old concept of subconscious and consciousness. Concentration is when consciousness is only thinking about the task at hand. The subconscious is in a state where it is serving consciousness instead of distracting it. The subconscious is a very complex, powerful and susceptible beast. It is the animal in us. Hundreds of millions of years of animal evolution forged its organization. Only hundreds of thousands of years forged consciousness. Actually much less if you consider written work. And just a few decades if you consider programming.
Now don't think that the subconscious is useless for programming. We teach our subconscious to understand and remember abstract models. We can teach it to combine these abstractions and create new abstractions. Without our subconscious, we wouldn't even be able to learn.
When I speak about subconscious and concentration, I use a very targeted family of verbs: "serving", "teaching", "learning", "understand", "remember". This is the same vocabulary you'd use if you were speaking about teaching a student. And like most students the subconscious is wild if untamed.
Even though concentration is the direct work of consciousness, it is the state of the subconscious that dictate if there is concentration or no concentration.

At the beginning of the blog I spoke about triggers to make concentration happen. There are many, many such triggers. There are many triggers that will kill your concentration as well. There are also triggers that will do both, because they will be very powerful to make you concentrate on a new task, even if you're in the middle of one.
A human voice beginning to speak to you will bring instant focus on that person. You cannot do much against that. And then this voice asking something from you will have a very strong power (just think about it). It will trigger instant concentration to perform the task that the person is demanding you.
This trigger has a word in the enterprise world, it is called management. But that's not the this trigger I want to speak about.

In software, direct command to perform a task shows its limits. In software, you need to be creative and perform tasks that you created for yourself, all the time. So you need to rely on other triggers than direct human interations. Ambition and pride, which is an indirect human interaction can be a strong trigger. But it is kind of a long term trigger, not a day to day, hour by hour trigger. Basically you need something to micro-manage your concentration. Avoiding interruptions by other people is important of course, but I think it is a bit of a no-brainer. It is avoiding interruptions from your subconscious that you ultimately want.

Subconscious interrupts you all the time. Slightly hungry? Come on, let's go for a snack! Can't concentrate? Come on, go for a coffee! Oh yeah, and you really messed up yesterday's date night, you should have waited for the third date. No really can't concentrate. Maybe I should change job.
That's what I mean by micro-managing the subconscious, avoiding that.

Recently I came across one particular startup that focuses on exactly that, helping you to avoid interruptions from your subconscious. It is very much at its beginning, and they are constantly trying different things, but a lot of people thank them. And I am among these people. The company is called focus@will. What they do is music and sounds to help you focus. In the past I've played a lot with working with music, all kinds of music. Or no music at all, tyring to have an environment as quiet as possible. Results vary a lot, and still depend on my mood. So what do they do differently? They simply tried different things and found patterns, and they tried to make the patterns repeatable. They've got researchers from various unversities helping them as well. The general principle is keeping your subconscious just slightly busy. The only problem with that is that you end up sleeping, and well, you don't want that obviously. So they realized that creating a slightly more important stimulation every 20 min would keep you awake and concentrated. Overall, continuous periods of 90 minutes of efficient work seems to be what most people achieve when listening to their streaming service.

This music is streamed through a web app or a mobile app, that you can find [here](https://www.focusatwill.com). It's definitely not rocket science, but to my knowledge this service is of a new kind. To tackle that, the guys behind the company have the passionate, humble and iterative approach that you want in that context. And for me the service works amazingly well. I am really impressed.
And surprised that this small startup is pretty much alone on the market. Especially considering how increasingly critical and difficult concentration is in today's work.

Note: Except my 1 year subscription, I don't have any stake whatsover in this company.

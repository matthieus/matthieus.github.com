"Software are Made by Humans, Mainly" is a category given to posts about how us, humans, can make good software. Software writing relies heavily on the human brain's creativity. Mathematics, Physics or Biology don't really help us there, not directly anyway. Making software is a very soft science, which makes a lot of people call it art. I don't care how we call it, but I guess you see my point, we are left alone with our cognitive capacity, experiences and social skills when building software.

Starting from that remark, building great software should be based on optimising brain work, human work. When creating software, our minds are used in very different activities, with a mix of social and individual work. Both having their constraints and their sweet spot of efficiency. Finding this sweet spot of efficiency for the different activities involved in making software, that's what this category is about.
